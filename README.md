Me getting used to the idea of GitHub

So where better to start than the introductory activity.

I am a graduate of The University of Akron in CIS and Lorain County Community College in Engineering Technology and am trying to forge a path that will allow me to do more work in the fields of networking, systems integration, and communications projects.

I'm getting started on GitHub to try to meet these goals in the most efficient way possible, try to prove my value in this field, and advance my career which is presently very much stalled out.
